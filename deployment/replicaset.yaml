# ReplicaSet
# ---------------
# Pod is the smallest kubernetes object, which we worked on.
# Next Level is replication controller.
# ReplicaSet is similar to replication controller.
# In replicatSet, we have an additional field in spec section called as "selector" field.
# This selector uses a child element called "matchLabels"   , where it will search for pods based on a 
# specific label name, and adds them to the cluster.
# Ex: Create a replicaset file to start 4 tomcat replicas and then perform scaling
